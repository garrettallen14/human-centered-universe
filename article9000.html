                <h2>The Importance of Ownership in a Post-TAI World</h2>
                <div class="date">July 6, 2024</div>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <h3>I. Introduction</h3>
                    <p>As we stand on the precipice of a technological revolution unlike any in human history, it's crucial to consider how the advent of Transformative Artificial Intelligence (TAI) will reshape our world. </p>
                    <p>TAI, defined as AI systems capable of outperforming humans in most economically valuable tasks, has the potential to fundamentally alter the structures of ownership, labor, and resource distribution that have underpinned human societies for millennia.</p>
                    <p>This article argues that in an early post-TAI world, ownership of income-producing assets will become the primary determinant of an individual's economic security and quality of life. As we navigate this transition, understanding the implications of TAI and taking proactive steps to secure ownership stakes may be the most important economic decision of our lifetimes.</p>

                    <h3>II. The Inevitability of TAI</h3>
                    <p>To appreciate the urgency of this issue, we must first recognize that the development of TAI is not a matter of if, but when. Two key factors support this assertion:</p>

                    <h4>A. Historical Trends in Economic Growth and Technological Progress</h4>
                    <p>Human history has been characterized by an accelerating pace of economic growth and technological advancement. David Roodman's groundbreaking analysis of Gross World Product (GWP) over the past 10,000 years reveals a clear pattern of superexponential growth (Roodman, 2020). This model suggests that we are rapidly approaching a point of explosive economic expansion, likely driven by transformative technologies like AI.</p>
                    <p>Roodman's work shows that the doubling time of the global economy has been steadily decreasing throughout history. What once took millennia now occurs in decades, and this trend shows no signs of slowing. If anything, it appears to be accelerating, pointing towards a future of unprecedented economic and technological change.</p>

                    <h4>B. Rapid Advancements in AI Capabilities</h4>
                    <p>In recent years, we've witnessed a staggering acceleration in AI capabilities. From mastering complex games like Go and poker to generating human-like text and creating photorealistic images, AI systems are increasingly matching or surpassing human performance across a wide range of tasks.</p>
                    <p>Notable milestones include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OpenAI's GPT-3, demonstrating remarkable natural language processing abilities</li>
                        <li>DeepMind's AlphaFold, making groundbreaking progress in protein folding prediction</li>
                        <li>GitHub Copilot, assisting programmers with code generation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These advancements, coupled with ongoing research into artificial general intelligence (AGI), suggest that we are on a trajectory towards developing AI systems capable of transforming nearly every aspect of our economy and society.</p>
                    <p>The convergence of these historical economic trends and recent technological breakthroughs makes the emergence of TAI seem not just possible, but inevitable. As we approach this inflection point, it's critical to consider how TAI will reshape our economic landscape and what steps individuals and societies can take to prepare.</p>

                    <h3>III. Economic Implications of TAI</h3>
                    <p>The arrival of Transformative AI will likely trigger a seismic shift in our economic structures, with two primary consequences:</p>

                    <h4>A. Mass Unemployment Due to AI Automation</h4>
                    <p>As AI systems become capable of performing most economically valuable tasks at a level surpassing human abilities, we can expect widespread displacement of human labor across virtually all sectors. This goes beyond the automation of routine, manual tasks that we've seen in previous waves of technological change. TAI has the potential to outperform humans in complex cognitive tasks, creative endeavors, and even in areas traditionally thought to require human judgment and intuition.</p>
                    <p>A 2013 study by Frey and Osborne at Oxford University estimated that 47% of US jobs were at high risk of automation in the coming decades. However, this analysis predated many recent AI breakthroughs. With the rapid progress we're now seeing, it's plausible that an even higher percentage of jobs could be at risk.</p>
                    <p>The economic implications of this shift are profound. In a world where AI can perform most tasks more efficiently and cost-effectively than humans, the majority of people may find themselves unable to compete economically. This could lead to unprecedented levels of unemployment and economic inequality.</p>

                    <h4>B. Concentration of Economic Power</h4>
                    <p>As AI systems become the primary drivers of economic production, we can expect a significant concentration of economic power in the hands of those who own and control these systems. This trend towards concentration is already visible in the tech sector, where a handful of large companies dominate the market due to network effects and economies of scale. The advent of TAI is likely to exacerbate this trend across all sectors of the economy.</p>
                    <p>A 2017 report by the McKinsey Global Institute highlighted that companies at the digital frontier are seeing much faster profit growth than other firms. In a post-TAI world, this disparity could become even more pronounced, with owners of advanced AI systems capturing an ever-larger share of economic output.</p>
                    <p>This concentration of economic power raises serious concerns about wealth inequality, which has already been increasing in many countries. A 2022 report by Oxfam found that the world's ten richest men more than doubled their fortunes during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the incomes of 99% of humanity fell. The emergence of TAI could accelerate this trend dramatically, potentially leading to levels of inequality unprecedented in human history.</p>

                    <h3>IV. Categories of People in a Post-TAI World</h3>
                    <p>Given these economic implications, we can broadly categorize people in a post-TAI world into three groups:</p>

                    <h4>A. Owners</h4>
                    <p>This group consists of individuals and entities who possess ownership stakes in TAI systems or other productive assets that leverage TAI. They stand to benefit enormously from the economic changes brought about by TAI, potentially seeing their wealth and influence grow exponentially.</p>
                    <p>Owners will likely include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shareholders of major tech companies developing TAI</li>
                        <li>Investors in AI startups and related technologies</li>
                        <li>Individuals who have acquired significant ownership of other productive assets (e.g., land, intellectual property) that can be leveraged by TAI</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The advantages for owners in a post-TAI world could be immense, potentially including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exponential growth in wealth as TAI systems generate unprecedented economic value</li>
                        <li>Influence over the development and deployment of TAI technologies</li>
                        <li>The ability to shape economic and social policies in a world where traditional forms of labor have been largely displaced</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>B. Group Members</h4>
                    <p>This category includes people who, while not direct owners of TAI systems, are part of organizations or societies that provide some level of economic security or resource distribution. Examples might include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Citizens of countries with robust social safety nets or universal basic income (UBI) programs</li>
                        <li>Employees of companies that choose to maintain a human workforce despite the availability of TAI alternatives</li>
                        <li>Members of cooperatives or other collective ownership structures that include TAI systems</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While potentially better off than those in the "vulnerable" category, group members may face significant uncertainties and potential vulnerabilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dependence on the continued goodwill or effectiveness of the distributing organization</li>
                        <li>Limited individual agency in economic decisions</li>
                        <li>Potential for reduced standard of living compared to the pre-TAI era, depending on the level of support provided</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>C. Vulnerable Populations</h4>
                    <p>This group comprises individuals who neither own productive assets nor belong to supportive organizations in the post-TAI world. They are at the highest risk of economic marginalization and deprivation. Vulnerable populations may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Residents of countries with weak institutions or rule of law</li>
                        <li>Individuals in regions with limited access to advanced technologies</li>
                        <li>Those without the education or resources to adapt to a TAI-driven economy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To quantify the potential scale of this vulnerability, we can look at current global poverty and governance indicators:</p>
                    <p>According to the World Bank's 2022 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report, about 648 million people globally lived in extreme poverty (less than $2.15 per day) in 2019. While this number has been decreasing, the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed some of this progress.</p>
                    <p>The World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index 2022 provides insight into countries where citizens may be particularly vulnerable. Some concerning examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Venezuela: 0.27 (out of 1) rule of law score, with 76.6% poverty rate</li>
                        <li>Afghanistan: 0.35 rule of law score, with 47.3% poverty rate</li>
                        <li>Democratic Republic of the Congo: 0.34 rule of law score, with 62.3% poverty rate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These figures suggest that hundreds of millions of people could be at high risk of economic marginalization in a post-TAI world if effective measures are not taken to broaden ownership or ensure equitable resource distribution.</p>

                    <h3>V. The Importance of Gaining Ownership Now</h3>
                    <p>Given the potential economic upheaval that TAI may bring, there is a strong argument that now - in the period leading up to the emergence of TAI - is the most critical time to acquire ownership stakes in productive assets.</p>

                    <h4>A. Limited Window of Opportunity</h4>
                    <p>The opportunity to gain meaningful ownership may be rapidly closing as we approach the TAI transition. Several factors contribute to this urgency:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accelerating technological progress: As AI capabilities advance, the timeline to TAI may be shorter than many expect. OpenAI's 2023 report on AI and economic growth suggests that AI could automate up to 80% of the US workforce within the next decade.</li>
                        <li>Increasing concentration of wealth and power: Even before TAI, we're seeing a trend towards greater concentration of wealth. The World Inequality Report 2022 shows that the share of global wealth held by the top 1% rose from 33% in 1995 to 38% in 2021.</li>
                        <li>Network effects and first-mover advantages: In the technology sector, early leaders often establish dominant positions that are difficult to challenge. This pattern may be even more pronounced with TAI.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>B. Potential Strategies for Individuals</h4>
                    <p>Given these considerations, individuals might consider the following strategies to gain ownership:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investing in AI and technology companies: This could include both established tech giants and promising startups working on advanced AI systems.</li>
                        <li>Acquiring productive assets: This might involve purchasing real estate, intellectual property, or shares in businesses that are likely to remain valuable in a TAI-driven economy.</li>
                        <li>Developing high-value skills: While not direct ownership, developing expertise in AI development, deployment, or governance could position individuals to gain ownership stakes in the future.</li>
                        <li>Participating in decentralized ownership structures: This could include investing in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or other blockchain-based ownership models that aim to distribute the benefits of AI more broadly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>C. Societal Implications</h4>
                    <p>The concentrated rush for ownership in anticipation of TAI raises significant ethical and societal concerns. If only a small fraction of the population secures meaningful ownership, it could lead to unprecedented levels of inequality and social instability.</p>
                    <p>To address these concerns, policymakers and society at large may need to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadening ownership through policy: This could include measures like universal basic capital, where every citizen is granted a stake in national wealth funds invested in productive assets including AI technologies.</li>
                        <li>Rethinking property rights and ownership models: As TAI reshapes the economy, we may need new frameworks for ownership that balance innovation incentives with equitable distribution of benefits.</li>
                        <li>Global cooperation: Given the potentially global impact of TAI, international coordination may be necessary to prevent a winner-takes-all scenario and ensure that the benefits of TAI are broadly shared.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>VI. Potential Scenarios for Resource Allocation Post-TAI</h3>
                    <p>As we approach the TAI transition, it's crucial to consider how resources might be allocated in a post-TAI world. Two broad scenarios emerge:</p>

                    <h4>A. AI-controlled Allocation</h4>
                    <p>In this scenario, AI systems are entrusted with the task of resource allocation across society.</p>
                    <p>Pros:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Potentially more efficient and optimal distribution based on complex data analysis</li>
                        <li>Reduction of human biases in decision-making</li>
                        <li>Ability to rapidly adjust to changing circumstances</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Risk of unintended consequences if AI goals are not perfectly aligned with human values</li>
                        <li>Potential loss of human agency in important decisions</li>
                        <li>Vulnerability to systemic errors or malicious manipulation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>B. Human-controlled Allocation</h4>
                    <p>Here, humans retain control over resource allocation, using TAI as a tool rather than the decision-maker.</p>
                    <p>Pros:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preservation of human values and ethical considerations in resource distribution</li>
                        <li>Maintenance of human agency and democratic processes</li>
                        <li>Ability to correct course if outcomes don't align with societal goals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Potential for continued or exacerbated inequality if existing power structures persist</li>
                        <li>Risk of suboptimal allocation due to human cognitive biases or limited processing capacity</li>
                        <li>Slower adaptation to changing circumstances compared to AI-driven systems</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>VII. Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>As we stand on the brink of a transformative era driven by artificial intelligence, the importance of ownership in productive assets cannot be overstated. The emergence of TAI has the potential to reshape our economic landscape in profound ways, potentially rendering traditional forms of labor obsolete and concentrating economic power in the hands of those who control these advanced AI systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>The analysis presented in this article underscores several key points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The development of TAI appears inevitable, driven by long-term economic trends and accelerating technological progress.</li>
                        <li>TAI is likely to cause widespread economic disruption, including mass unemployment and increased concentration of wealth.</li>
                        <li>In a post-TAI world, individuals may broadly fall into categories of owners, group members, or vulnerable populations, with vastly different economic prospects.</li>
                        <li>There is a limited window of opportunity to acquire meaningful ownership stakes before the TAI transition occurs.</li>
                        <li>The way resources are allocated in a post-TAI world - whether by AI systems or humans - will have profound implications for society.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These realities present both opportunities and challenges. For individuals, there is an urgent need to consider strategies for gaining ownership in productive assets that will retain value in a TAI-driven economy. This might involve investing in AI companies, acquiring other valuable assets, or developing high-level skills in AI-related fields.</p>

                    <p>However, the broader societal implications cannot be ignored. If the benefits of TAI are concentrated in the hands of a few, it could lead to levels of inequality and social instability that threaten the very fabric of our societies. As such, there is a pressing need for policymakers, business leaders, and citizens to engage in serious discussions about how to ensure a more equitable distribution of the benefits of TAI.</p>

                    <p>Potential approaches could include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implementing universal basic capital or similar schemes to broaden ownership</li>
                        <li>Developing new models of collective ownership for AI technologies</li>
                        <li>Creating robust social safety nets to support those displaced by AI</li>
                        <li>Investing in education and retraining programs to help people adapt to the new economy</li>
                        <li>Exploring global governance frameworks to manage the transition to a TAI world</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The decisions we make now, in the lead-up to the TAI transition, will shape the economic and social landscape for generations to come. By recognizing the critical importance of ownership in the coming era, and taking proactive steps to address the challenges it presents, we can strive to create a future where the transformative power of AI benefits not just a select few, but humanity as a whole.</p>

                    <p>The path forward is not yet clear, but one thing is certain: the time to act is now. The future of ownership in a post-TAI world is being determined today, and we all have a stake in shaping that future.</p>
